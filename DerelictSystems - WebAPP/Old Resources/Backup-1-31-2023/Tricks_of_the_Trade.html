            <p class="p" style="text-align:left">
              When it comes to hackers, money is usually on their mind. This year, just as years past, financially motivated cybercrime continues to grow since it appears to pay well. In this article, we will look at the main way hackers get in and what they often do to make money off of you, one way or another. First up, we have the tried-and-true method of gaining unauthorized access. Phishing!                
              <br></br>
              I know you've heard it a million times. Don't click that email! However, phishing is much more complex these days than plain old emails. These days there are tons of different phishing methods, and the number grows every year. Sure, phishing can still refer to emails; but that is just scratching the surface. Now we have, 'Whaling' when targeting C-Suite or executive staff, 'Spear Phishing' when using targeted attacks on a specific individual, 'Vishing' when the attacker uses phone calls, 'Smishing' attacks that use Text messaging (SMS) or social media messengers, 'Pharming', 'Watering Hole Phishing', and tons more. In our modern health-minded world, we are seeing more technology being implemented to minimize hands-on interactions with ordinary objects. For instance, when you go to a restaurant now, you may be presented with a QR code to scan with your phone to view the menu. This is totally normal now but would make a great target for Watering Hole Phishing. A twist on the classic compromising a website your targets visit, you may now be attacked by scanning that QR code you believe is legitimate at your literal watering hole! The attacker may craft fake QR codes that link to a carefully crafted website or server hosting malware or who knows what else. Phishing has evolved into almost every aspect that is able to reach you technologically and hit the point of being so pervasive that no one will fault you for not answering your phone calls right away if the number is not known to you. Phone manufacturers include blocking unknown callers by default now! Be wary of communications in all forms from those who are trying to get something from you.    
              <br></br>
              Crypto is as volatile a topic as it is a marketplace. Left and right, we see breaches in crypto exchanges which lose millions of dollars in value belonging to their users. Individuals cry for joy and sadness depending on the swings of their coin value. Weirdly enough, something about fake monkeys worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, that can't be right, can it? The crypto world is a questionable marketplace where millions are made, and dreams come true! Unless you get stuck holding the bag. This unstable landscape of ever-changing popularity and value provides a great haven for hackers and other bad actors to launder money in hard or impossible to trace ways. This is where crypto mining comes into play.   The basic idea is that you use your computer's resources to 'mine' a crypto currency. This is essentially a trade of your computer's storage or computing power being lent out to accomplish a task and in return you get rewarded with fractional pieces of data that make up 'coins'. This varies by coin in process, but an attacker could use these coins to launder money, buy illicit goods or services, or generally speculate/gamble on flipping coins for more value like in a legitimate currency exchange. What would be better than using a single device to mine these coins? You guessed it, using everyone else's devices to mine. More hands make less work and all that! The instances of crypto-miner malware being found in the wild and installed on victim's devices continue to grow as this turbulent market struggles to hit mainstream acceptance. If the concept of crypto-based currency is fully adopted into common acceptance, these attacks are sure to rise as a common source of passive monetary theft. This malware normally runs in the background and may be hard to detect. Keep an eye on your electricity bill! Better yet, shut off your devices when they are not actively in use. This will prolong their life and prevent abuse when you aren't around.
              <br></br>
                If crypto mining isn't in the cards, there is another way to get money from a compromised victim. Ransomware continues to be a big money maker for attackers and a nightmare for victims. When we look at our work devices we picture responsibilities, deadlines, data that is crucial to our livelihood. Looking the opposite direction towards our personal devices, we see connections to family and friends, photos and memories, life planning like banking and learning. Attackers see business and sentimental values as nothing but dollar signs. Several hours after ordering lunch from your favorite restaurant, you may notice a new popup appearing on your screen or perhaps a new text file enticingly named 'Readme.txt'. These are just the start of the troubles to come. Attackers will often encrypt the data on your device and every device on the same network that they can reach or compromise. This may also include cloud backup services or even long-term storage, depending on their intent and goals. The result is your devices and data become inaccessible. They often promise to restore access for a fee. Sometimes reasonable, and sometimes egregious, depending on the attacker's mood, sense of value in the data, or sheer whim at any given moment. While we've seen some attackers take pity on those less fortunate or certain industries like healthcare, this is not the norm. The attacker will expect you to pay up to regain what they've encrypted. Often, this payment will be requested in the form of a crypto currency to ease transfer and hide where the money goes. We highly advise that you never pay the ransom as this emboldens the attacker and incentivizes future attacks. Who's to say they decrypt your files instead of taking the money and running? Or that they won't be back for round two of extortion? The best solution to this issue is to ensure all your files are backed up and backed up properly. You can turn to the 3-2-1 rule for an easy guideline. 
              <br></br>
              3: Create three sets of your data. One primary back up and two copies of that. If your primary back up is compromised, you have the other two to fall back on. 
              <br></br>
              2: save your backups to two different media types. This helps with fault tolerance in media. Having one backup drive is not great if the drive fails. However, a hard drive and a tape backup provide greater probability of data availability.
              <br></br>
              1: Keep at least one backup offsite. This mitigates local attacks and ensures the data cannot be compromised at the same time as the original data.                
              <br></br>
              Financial gain is the name of the game and this is just a small look at how attackers can get in and make money. So maybe let those calls go to voicemail and keep an eye out whenever someone new needs something from you. Be careful where you download apps from and be wary of programs that sound to good to be true when they promise to make your complex tasks super simple. They may contain a crypto-miner service that runs in the background. Lastly, always ensure your back-up plan is solid and secure. No one wants to lose years of family photos or months of work due to ransomware!
              <br></br>
