            <p class="p">
                I'd personally like to own a Tesla someday. The sleek design, modern upscale look, and let's not forget the pretty cool technology packed into them. Say what you will about software limits and over-pricing for features. I doubt that those concerns are on the minds of security researchers and hackers. If anything, that adds to the value! New tech to examine and debug, tracing system calls, and excitement when you find out how much you can control! For some, there is also the chance to ride away without ever paying for it.
                <br></br>
                For years, Tesla has pushed accessibility and technology-based access control as a fundamental feature of their vehicles. Over as many years, we've seen hackers steal their cars, security researchers discover and provide proof of concepts for exploits and vulnerabilities, and the sensational news articles that go hand in hand with the fame of Tesla and the fear of losing a vehicle. Some of the methods for access control include cell phone apps, key fobs, and NFC cards. Each has been found wanting in the security area. Lets take a look at past hacks involving each of these!
                <br></br>
                Starting with key fobs. Tesla's key fobs use a cyrptographically encrypted code sent over the air using radio frequencies. These codes are verified by the car's computer to determine if they are authentic. Security researchers figured out, in 2019, that capturing two of these codes, during locking or unlocking of the vehicle, would allow you to determine the cryptographic key needed to spoof any corresponding key fob in an astoundingly short 1.6 seconds! Capturing these two codes, researchers were able to brute force a working cryptographic key by making a table containing every possible combination. This ended up being a 6 terabyte table of possibilities. Once computed, they could spoof the signals needed to unlock your doors and drive away without the target being any the wiser that their key signal was stolen and used to take their expensive car!
                <br></br>
                Moving on to last year, in 2021. The bluetooth connectivity feature of your cell phone could also lead to your ride being jacked! In this case, the culprit is not an advanced threat or some sophisticated hacker. They were opportunistic door handle checkers! We're always told to lock your car, hide your things, take your keys. But what happens when your phone is the key? For one person, living in an apartment, with his Tesla parked right outside, this meant he could easily lose his car to a thief. In this case, the feature at fault is the passive entry mode. Tesla's are constantly sending out challenge requests looking for an authenticated response. When you install the Tesla mobile app and have it configured to access your vehicle, this allows the car to unlock and start based on the proximity of the phone to the car! The range is up to 30 feet even. We can easily see how this can be abused. In this case, the owner was sleeping in his apartment when a thief came around checking cars to burglarize. When the thief got to this Tesla, the doors opened! More than that, the car started up! The phone belonging to the sleeping car owner was close enough to authorize entry and startup of the car. Fortunately, the thief didn't make it far before placing the car in park. Once in park, the car can not be put back into drive without the owner's phone nearby. The car was recovered and this 'hack' had a happy ending.
                <br></br>
                The third attack is one that is all too familiar to attackers and penetration testers alike. This time around, you can enroll your own key using NFC cards! Modern Tesla models come with 2 NFC cards with your vehicle purchase. These are able to unlock and start your Tesla. The intent was for guest access like valet parking, preventing you from being stranded if your cell phone died, or as another option if you lost or broke the key fob. A security researcher found that these cards are given access to not only unlock and start your car, but also enable the enrollment of new keys through the key management feature of the vehicle! Worse still is that there is no notification or onscreen indication that a new key is being enrolled. This enrollment period is for the first 130 seconds after the card is unlocked using an authorized NFC card. This key management issue has no current solution from Tesla at this time. So remember to check your authorized keys the next time you valet park or lend your car out!
                <br></br>
                This is only scratching the surface of the type of vulnerabilities "smarter" cars can contain. All things considered, having your car stolen can make for a bad day, but it is not the worst outcome. With the amount of known routes an attacker can take to drive off in your car, one has to wonder how many others are not yet known. Worse still, how many other systems are vulnerable to abuse? As more connectivity features get packed into our personal vehicles and self-driving cars become a closer possibility, we have to wonder what future threats we will see.

              Qucik convient access to your automobile is all the rage in our increasingly connected world. Tesla is well known to be on the bleeding edge
              of car design and technological gadgetry. It should come as no surprise that greater connectivity and functionality can lead to new vulnerabilities!
